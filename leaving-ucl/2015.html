      <h1>On leaving University College London</h1>
<p>September 7, 2015</p>


<p><span class="marginnote"><strong>TL;DR</strong>: I applied to MIT a year before finishing and I dropped out from the 4 year course at UCL</span> In the last few days, I had this recurring conversation on how I left University College London.</p>

<p>I was coming from an intense experience at Mozilla, where I strengthen my interest in decentralizing the web. I felt that the time spent in London was not going in that direction. Although the time spent at University College London was really exciting, I felt that was not the place I wanted to be. I wanted to work on my ideas, like <a href="http://github.com/nicola/bubbles">Bubbles</a><sup class="sidenote-number">1</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup class="sidenote-number">1</sup> Interoperable decentralized data storage</span>, <a href="http://github.com/nicola/crowd">crowd</a> and I could not find professors interested in web protocols, standards and decentralized systems; more than that, very few undergraduate students carry on research with professors at UCL. I really believe I can make a change, but I felt I didn’t have the tools. It has been extremely complicated and psychologically stressful time.</p>

<p>I remember when, a two years ago, discussing with <a href="https://github.com/sorig">Esben</a> and <a href="https://github.com/verajohne">Vera</a>, I said “<em>if I will ever work for a company, I would work for Mozilla, if I will ever do a PhD, I want to go at MIT working with Tim Berners Lee</em>. That was pure daydreaming, but <strong>is all this <em>wondering</em> just words that we say, or reality we wish it could happen?</strong></p>

<p>So, I decided to apply to MIT - even though I needed one more year to graduate. I had found out that one could drop out from the degree and leave with a BSc in Computing, instead of Computer Science. So, I decided, that if that was the case, I would have gone that route<sup class="sidenote-number">2</sup><span class="sidenote"><sup class="sidenote-number">2</sup> I found out that BSc in Computing is basically equivalent to Computer Science, University of Cambridge and Imperial College London for example, only award this title</span>.</p>

<p>Because I feared that not having a final year dissertation could have been a minus, I worked hard with Ellery to get <a href="http://www.emnlp2015.org/accepted-papers.html">A Strong Lexical Matching Method for the Machine Comprehension Test</a> published at <a href="http://www.emnlp2015.org">EMNLP 2015</a>. Also, a couple of weeks ago, I got informed that I have been awarded the <strong>Dean’s List Award</strong> for <em>Outstanding academic performance</em>.</p>

<p>At the end I got in and it all played well.</p>

<p>Family and friends were very close in this period of stress and internal crisis (especially September to December), I would not have had this strength otherwise.</p>
