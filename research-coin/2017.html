      <h1>Idea: Research Coin and futuristic research labs</h1>
<p>April 1, 2017</p>


<h2 id="futuristic-research-labs">Futuristic research labs</h2>

<p>A few months ago, I started asking myself this question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>How can we run a futuristic research lab and fund great research?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the type of questions that the excellent people at <a href="https://protocol.ai">Protocol Labs Inc.</a> are also trying to tackle. Their strategy as a company and as an industry R&amp;D&amp;D lab is to launch token-based network protocols and use the token sales to fund new research.</p>

<p>Universities are not companies, and it is difficult to fund research from which the outcomes are unknown (or yet to be researched!). Given the incentive power that <em>tokens</em> have in these new blockchain-based decentralized systems, I  wonder if we can borrow some ideas from these systems to rethink the way we fund and we run university research labs.</p>

<p>The above question lead to another question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Can we fund research at MIT by launching an MITCoin?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I am still trying to answer that question, I have no clear idea about what values an MITCoin could actually bring. Is there a more generic <em>Research Coin</em> that can be used to reward great research?</p>

<p>In the rest of this post, I am describing a sort of proposal for <em>Research Coin</em>.
My plan here is to update this blogpost and propose a lot of bad ideas, which I don’t necessarly endorse. Hopefully a great idea will come out of this, if you are interested in the problem or you are running a research lab and want to be part of this conversation, please get in touch with me! :)</p>

<h2 id="attempt-1-research-coin">Attempt 1: Research Coin</h2>

<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Reward academics for their good research</li>
  <li>Finding new funding strategy beyond grants!</li>
  <li>Incentivize peer-review</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Assumption 0: There is a set of great peer-reviewed conferences/journal</li>
  <li>Assumption 1: A research paper is good if it gets reviewed from those</li>
  <li>Assumption 2: Peer review is always wise and unbiased</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="idea">Idea</h3>
<ul>
  <li><em>Oracles</em>: There is a set of well known conferences that is chosen and they are trusted to reveal the published papers (we can just rely on HTTPS)</li>
  <li><em>Minting Tokens</em>: If a paper is published in one of these conferences, the paper receives a reward (that can is shared between the authors) (can still be automated)</li>
  <li><em>Tokens</em>: Tokens can be exchanged and sold by the academics</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-to-do-with-these-tokens-crazy-ideas-starting-here">What to do with these tokens? (crazy ideas starting here)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Reputation score</strong></p>

    <p>Organizations that support research could have a reputation score based on how much they have donated to academics (?).</p>

    <p>For example: A company can be a sponsor of the conference only if they have a minimum amount of research coins</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Incentivizing Peer-Review</strong></p>

    <p>A peer-to-peer network of peer reviewers can review the papers, and bet whether a paper will be accepted or not for a particular conference. On the conference deadlines, all the winning reviewers get rewarded. This system could re-create interesting behaviors, where peer-reviewers will try to look for great papers that need some more work and give comments to the authors.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="questions">Questions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Are there better uses for the token? (I think the peer review betting idea can be really powerful - although there should be no insider trading!)</li>
  <li>Are the assumptions correct?</li>
  <li>Do these ideas distort the way we do research?</li>
</ul>

<p>I also have other inexplored ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Can we find a way for researchers to “bet” on their research?</li>
  <li>Can we turn the reputation of citations into revenue streams?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="future-directions">Future directions</h3>

<p>I am struggling to see why Attempt 1 can really work, and I scared it might incentivize new types of behaviour (corrupted peer reviewers!) or even disagreement on who decides, who is in the “closed” circle of conferences and journals.</p>

<h2 id="attempt-2-university-coin">Attempt 2: University Coin</h2>

<p>This idea comes from a midnight conversation with Matt from MIT.
It’s an improvement (or different attempt) for a <a href="http://nicola.io/research-coin/2017">Research Coin</a>.</p>

<h3 id="new-token-model">New token model</h3>

<p>Each institution, research lab or group can create an “org”.
Each <em>org</em> is assigned 100 org-tokens that are specific to the <em>org</em>. For example, the <em>org</em> “MIT” will have MITCoin, “Cornell” will have CornellCoin and so on. Even a specific lab, can decide to create an <em>org</em>, for example MIT PDOS can create a PDOS token. An <em>org</em> can decide whether to sell or not their 100 <em>org</em>-tokens.</p>

<h3 id="betting-system">Betting system</h3>

<p>Similarly to Research Coin, anyone can bet on a paper being accepted at a specific conference. However, one can bet on a paper by using the <em>org</em>-token representing the <em>org</em> used by the researchers. In other words, if I want to bet that the MIT paper will be accepted, I must bet tokens from MIT.</p>

<p>Bets run in rounds, for each conference, owners of tokens can bet org-tokens on papers from a specific org. When papers are selected by the conference, all the lost bets are split proportionally (however, I am not sure how, this is actually non-trivial) to the amount they bet.</p>

<h3 id="intuitions">Intuitions</h3>

<p>The intuition here is that universities (and research labs) can use do great research to increase the value of their tokens, since many would prefer to bet on their research. I expect that the token of a very active university will have a higher price, but bets will have a low risk, hence a lower return, however, I will need to revisit this intuition soon.</p>

<p>This is however is more difficult to implement in practice than idea 1. This requires research organizations to actively create orgs and sell a percentage of their coins (well, we can still bootstrap this with researchers getting reward coins for their published research..!)</p>

<p>I am overall convinced that this is NOT a good idea yet. I am not sure if betting on research paper passing through a conference is the best use of a currency.</p>

<h3 id="questions-1">Questions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Would this lead to making great research or would this be optimize for short-term good publishable research?</li>
  <li>Can universities do “ICO”s for selling betting credit for their university?</li>
  <li>Would this really increase peer-review or there will just be speculation?</li>
</ul>

<p>Help me think about Attempt 3!</p>

<!-- ## Action points
- Creating a system uses conference webpages or google scholar as trusted oracle should be easy
- We could create a research coin based on ETH in a very simple way -->
