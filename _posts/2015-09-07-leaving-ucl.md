{% marginnote '__TL;DR__: I applied to MIT a year before finishing and I dropped out from the 4 year course at UCL'%}In the last few days, I had this recurring conversation on how I left University College London.

I was coming from an intense experience at Mozilla, where I strengthen my interest in decentralizing the web. I felt that the time spent in London was not going in that direction. Although the time spent at University College London was really exciting, I felt that was not the place I wanted to be. I wanted to work on my ideas, like [Bubbles](http://github.com/nicola/bubbles){% sidenote 1 'Interoperable decentralized data storage'%}, [crowd](http://github.com/nicola/crowd) and I could not find professors interested in web protocols, standards and decentralized systems; more than that, very few undergraduate students carry on research with professors at UCL. I really believe I can make a change, but I felt I didn't have the tools. It has been extremely complicated and psychologically stressful time.

I remember when, a two years ago, discussing with [Esben](https://github.com/sorig) and [Vera](https://github.com/verajohne), I said "_if I will ever work for a company, I would work for Mozilla, if I will ever do a PhD, I want to go at MIT working with Tim Berners Lee_. That was pure daydreaming, but __is all this _wondering_ just words that we say, or reality we wish it could happen?__

So, I decided to apply to MIT - even though I needed one more year to graduate. I had found out that one could drop out from the degree and leave with a BSc in Computing, instead of Computer Science. So, I decided, that if that was the case, I would have gone that route{% sidenote 2 'I found out that BSc in Computing is basically equivalent to Computer Science, University of Cambridge and Imperial College London for example, only award this title'%}.

Because I feared that not having a final year dissertation could have been a minus, I worked hard with Ellery to get [A Strong Lexical Matching Method for the Machine Comprehension Test](http://www.emnlp2015.org/accepted-papers.html) published at [EMNLP 2015](http://www.emnlp2015.org). Also, a couple of weeks ago, I got informed that I have been awarded the __Dean's List Award__ for _Outstanding academic performance_.

At the end I got in and it all played well.

Family and friends were very close in this period of stress and internal crisis (especially September to December), I would not have had this strength otherwise.
