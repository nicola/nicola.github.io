The Web we have had for the last 25 years is a selection of standards that Tim and the World Wide Web Consortium have written down.

Standards - as we know them today - are a top down approach. Surely they can be start as an organic need by different communities, let's say HTML5 was not decided by the Heaven of the Web.

What I am presenting today is the idea of having machines that learn how to exchange data and adapt accordingly. In other words, imagine I write something of the kind:

"Name: nicola, Surname: greco"

A machine should still be able to communicate to another machine, without all the formality of protocols - e.g. respecting a markup language

Maybe machine should be taught principles rather than standards
