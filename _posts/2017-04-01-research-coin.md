## Futuristic research labs
A few months ago I started wondering: *How can we run a futuristic research lab and fund great research?*

These are the questions that the excellent people at [Protocol Labs Inc.](https://protocol.ai) are also trying to tackle. Their strategy as a company and as an industry R&D&D lab is to launch token-based network protocols and use the token sale to fund new research.

Universities are not companies, and it is difficult to fund research from which the outcomes are unknown (or yet to be researched!). Given the incentive power that *tokens* have in these new blockchain-based decentralized systems, I  wonder if we can borrow some ideas from these systems to rethink the way we fund and we run university research labs.

I have no clear idea - yet! - and I would like to start a conversation so that we can get crazy!
My plan is to propose a lot of bad ideas (I will update this post through time), from which hopefully one will be great, or will inspire one of you to contact me! :)

# Research Coin

## Motivation
- Reward academics for their good research
- Finding new funding strategy beyond grants!
- Incentivize peer-review

## Assumptions
- Assumption 1: A research paper is good if it gets in a peer reviewed journal
- Assumption 2: Peer review is wise and unbiased

## Idea
- Oracles: there is a set of well known conferences that is chosen and they are trusted to reveal the published papers (we can just rely on HTTPS)
- Minting Tokens: If a paper is published in one of these conferences, the paper receives a reward (that can is shared between the authors) (can still be automated)
- Tokens: tokens can be exchanged and sold by the academics

## What to do with these tokens? (crazy ideas starting here)

1. Reputation score
Organizations that support research could have a reputation score based on how much they have donated to academics (????).
For example: A company can be a sponsor of the conference only if they have a minimum amount of research coins
2. Incentivizing Peer-Review
A peer-to-peer network of peer reviewers can review the papers, and bet whether a paper will be accepted or not (????)

## Questions

- Are there better uses for the token? (I think the peer review betting idea can be really powerful - although there should be no insider trading!)
- Are the assumptions correct?
- Do these ideas distort the way we do research?
- New ideas:
 - Can we find a way for researchers to “bet” on their research?
 - Can we turn the reputation of citations into revenue streams?

<!-- ## Action points
- Creating a system uses conference webpages or google scholar as trusted oracle should be easy
- We could create a research coin based on ETH in a very simple way -->
