tl;dr

- Each university has 100 tokens and they can sell them at any time
- Token holders of a specific university can use these tokens to bet on university paper’s being accepted.
- Betting on papers from good university will be a low risk investment that will make the university token go up in price.

The **assumptions** are the same: there is a trusted oracle which is the conference accepting great papers. The **motivations** are the same: (1) create new funding for academia, (2) make good research, (3) incentivize peer review.

**Disclaimer**:  I actually DON’T like this idea since it optimises for short-term good papers. I think universities should play a longer term than just “have papers accepted"

# University Coin

This idea comes from a midnight conversation with Matt from MIT.
It's an improvement (or different attempt) for a [Research Coin](http://nicola.io/research-coin/2017) from last time.

## New token model

Each institution, research lab or group can create an "org".
Each *org* is assigned 100 org-tokens that are specific to the *org*.
For example, the *org* "MIT" will have MITCoin, "Cornell" will have CornellCoin and so on. An *org* can decide whether to sell or not their 100 *org*-tokens.

Note: Even a specific lab, can decide to create an *org*, for example MIT PDOS can create a PDOS token.

## Betting system

A peer-to-peer network of peer reviewers can review the papers, and bet whether a paper will be accepted or not for a particular conference.
On the conference deadlines, all the winning reviewers get rewarded.
This system could re-create interesting behaviors, where peer-reviewers will try to look for great papers that need some more work and give comments to the authors.

Similarly to Research Coin, anyone can bet on a paper being accepted at a specific conference.
However, one can bet on a paper by using the *org*-token representing the *org* used by the researchers.
In other words, if I want to bet that the MIT paper will be accepted, I must bet tokens from MIT.

Bets run in rounds, for each conference, owners of tokens can bet org-tokens on papers from a specific org.
When papers are selected by the conference, all the lost bets are split proportionally (however, I am not sure how, this is actually non-trivial) to the amount they bet.

## Intuitions

The intuition here is that: as universities (and research labs)  do great research, the value of their tokens would, since many would prefer to bet on their research.
I expect that the token of a very successful university will have a higher price, but bets will have a low risk, hence a lower return.

I am overall convinced that this is NOT a good idea yet. I am not sure if betting on research paper passing through a conference is the best use of a currency.

## Questions
- Would this lead to making great research or would this be optimize for short-term good publishable research?
- Can universities do "ICO"s for selling betting credit for their university?
- Would this really increase peer-review or there will just be speculation?
