People from the Internet,
I will make this very simple,
we live in a strange web.

Data is not yours,
services don’t interoperate,
you are locked in very many walled-garden,
there is someone in the middle of your interactions,
(actually, every time the same folks)
web pages disappear/die every 100 days,
Online identity - what the heck is even that?

[breath]

At the same time,
Internet connection got better,
our computers much faster
our devices are all connected,
storage is cheap.

Why don’t we - society, individuals and companies - start to build technologies that take advantage of this?

Let’s bring decentralization{% sidenote 2 'Read about my principle for a [Decentralized Web](http://nicola.io/decentralized-principles/2015/)' %} at the center of attention.

Now, in practice, I haven't started a center{% sidenote 1 'yet.' %}. I like to call the meetings that we are starting in Boston with the name "Center for Decentralization" (every other Friday at 4:30 at the Berkman Center/MIT).
