RDF is an simple and powerful language to describe data. However, playing with RDF data can get very tricky - especially when doing simple things. Only by solving the user experience of RDF libraries we would really get developers to user RDF more{% sidenote 1 'In all of its forms, _turtle_, _json-ld_, and so on.' %}. This blog post is directed to the community that works in this field and it is an open call to work on an ultimate, simpler library for RDF.

I will now show you three ways to do a very simple task (1) the current way (using [rdf-ext](http://github.com/rdf-ext/rdf-ext){% sidenote 2 'I have been recently involved with the development of this library' %}) (2) the way developers find familiar (3) the way the future RDF lib should be.

## The current RDF way

_Example 1:_ Creating a graph with a triple that represents my name

```javascript
var rdf = require('rdf-ext')
var me = rdf.createGraph()
me.add(new rdf.Triple(
  new rdf.NamedNode('http://nicola.io'),
  new rdf.NamedNode('http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name'),
  new rdf.Literal('Nicola')
  ))
```

_Example 2:_ Retrieving my name from the graph

```javascript
me.match(
  'http://nicola.io',
  'http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name')[0]
  .object
  .toString()
// Nicola
```

## The Javascript Objects way

Now, to the RDF experts, this might sound about right, but let's remember one second how _real world_ developers would do something like that, let's say using Javascript Objects.

_Example 3:_ The equivalent of Example 1 and 2 using JSON

```javascript
var me = {
  name: 'Nicola'
}

me.name
// Nicola
```

## The future RDF way

The future RDF library should provide a seamless experience to the developer that is used to the JS object.

_Example 4:_ The equivalent of Example 1 and 2 as it should be

```javascript
var r = require('simplerdf')
var me = r()
r['http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name'] = 'Nicola'

r['http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name']
// Nicola
```

Even simpler, I should be able to load an JSON-LD context to achieve the following

```javascript
var me = r()
me.context({
  'name': 'http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name',
  'homepage': {
    '@id': 'http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage',
    '@type': '@id'
  }
})
me.name = 'Nicola'

me.name
// Nicola
```

In other words, the key hack is on `Object.defineProperty` which enable us to redefine the getters/setters of object properties. So, in other words, we can have the power of a graph, behind some simple operations.

As a last note, as many of you may point out, these examples only show how to do operations when both the subject and the predicate are known - what about the rest?

In my opinion, this is already a big step forward simplifying RDF, maybe there are some operations would not be possible to achieve, and we can always come back to the traditional way of handling a graph `me.toGraph()`, or we can find together some new clever solutions that have the same spirit of simplicity.

## Conclusion

I implemented most of what presented here in a library called [simplerdf](http://github.com/nicola/simplerdf) - please, have a look at [further examples](https://github.com/nicola/simplerdf/tree/master/examples). However, as you may expect, this library is not stable at all, the APIs could change drastically in the next few days.

If you are interested, I really would like to hear from you, and maybe fork the Github repository and contribute, so that maybe, we could really write the future RDF library together.

Inspired by this [repo](https://github.com/webr3/js3) that has been written 5 years ago.
