In this article I will briefly introduce the my three key aspects that a decentralized web I think should have.

1. Users are in __Control__ of their data
2. __Interoperability__ across the services on the web and
3. __Portability__ of the data

Hopefully, I will go deeper in the next few days. In the meantime, please tell me what are the principles that you care about and how we can extend this.

I am soon going to set up a mailing list for MIT, Harvard friends and passionates, please ping me if you want to get involved [@nicolagreco](http://twitter.com).

**Update**: The post is trending on HackerNews and I would like to point out something to the readers. This post is an introductory post and the aim of this post is to continue to spark and foster interest in this field as well as starting the conversation of _What are the principles that matter to you and why?_
