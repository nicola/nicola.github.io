In this article I will briefly introduce three key aspect that the decentralized web should, in my opinion, have.

1. Users are in __Control__ of their data
2. __Interoperability__ across the services on the web and
3. __Portability__ of the data

Hopefully, I will go deeper in the next few days. In the meantime, please tell me what are the principles that you care about and how we can extend this.

I am soon going to set up a mailing list for Harvard/MIT and passionates, please ping me if you want to get involved.
