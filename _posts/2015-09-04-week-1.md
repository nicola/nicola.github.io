So, I decided to follow [Andrei](https://www.facebook.com/cioara.andrei)'s idea, based on my original idea of weekly updates on my life. <!--more-->

So, yes, it is now official, I am now at MIT. I just arrived in this exciting place with my father. I have been buying furniture, getting a student card, having dinner with my research group that has been extremely welcoming, making new Indian, Mexican and Italian friends (and so many other nationalities).

I have been to plenty of orientation events, that made me revive all the great moments I had in my first year at UCL. Boat cruise, night walks, and more than everything else, meeting a lot of new people everyday. Although Cambridge has been great so far, I do miss London, the Londoners and the adopted Londoners I met in the last three years{% sidenote 1 'I did my undergraduate studies at University College London' %}.

Tonight I have seen the dome for the first time, and it has been a magic couple of seconds.
