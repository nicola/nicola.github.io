#### Bio

Nicola Greco is a Ph.D. student in the _Decentralized Information Group_ at MIT. He writes and advances research on ways to re-decentralize the web, focusing on technical, political, and social aspects of decentralized systems both at MIT and the Berkman Center for Internet and Society.

He started writing code when he was very young. He was __14__ when he started the petition _“Linux in Italian Schools”_, converting schools to use Open Source Software; __16__, when he started the _BuddyPress’ developers community_ - an open source platform for federated social networks; __17__, when he made one of the first unofficial Twitter buttons (two years before they came out); __18__, he wrote software for Social Network analysis used by Telecom Italia that awarded him two research grants. The latter was key for his exposure; all of a sudden he was traveling around Europe, gave a TEDx and appeared Italian Wired Top __10__ under __25__.

He is now __22__ and determined to work on re-decentralizing the Web - probably influenced by working at Mozilla and as a reaction to writing software for tracking people on social media.
